# Mobility Hackathon -  Predict the Surge pricing type for cab service
There has been exponential growth in cab services for the last few years. In order to help more, in this problem, we predict the type of dynamic pricing needed for a particular cab ride based on various features like Trip distance, the lifestyle of the customer, customer rating, destination, etc.  If applied correct surge pricing type, customer rating and revenue will increase.
This is a Multiclass Classification problem. Applied XGBoost Classifier to get better accuracy than the other Classifiers.
